              <p class="lead"><a href="https://taskops.net/">TaskOps</a> is a new way to handle <strong>task schduling</strong> for medium-sized enterprise businesses.
              We are a perfect fit for any company that generates a lot of tasks and needs to schedule them. 
              
              TaskOps is based on the idea that task-scheduling is an optimization problem that can be solved using planning algorithms
              which enables happier more productive teams. TaskOps measures employee experience (total tasks they've completed ever),
              employee skills (you define which employees have which skills), priority (based on task priority) and availability that
              employees can set on the sprint calendar. TaskOps adjusts estimates by small factors to match experience and difficulty.
              We currently support <a href="https://teamwork.com">Teamwork PM</a> (Jira, Monday.com coming soon), which means your tasks stay where they are, in a single system 
              but your employees get there own schedule address to check what they are working on that day.</p>

            <p>You'll notice that the TaskOps main navigation bar is in order. Skills need to be created before
                Task Types are defined. Employees should be imported before importing tasks to a sprint. Using this
                guide, you should be able to get your company up and running in only a few minutes.
